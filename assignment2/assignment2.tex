\section{Introduction}



\section{Heard it through the {\sc Git}vine}

Heard it through the {\sc Git}vine: an empirical study of tool diffusion across the npm ecosystem~\cite{lamba2020heard}.

\subsection{Theory}
The theory played a central role in shaping the research questions for this paper. As noted in Section 2, the research question being explored is``How do the four other important attributes of innovations impact their diffusion?"
 These attributes are observability, relative advantage, compatibility with the adopter's context, and relative complexity, all of which are named among the five attributes of innovations that influence adoption, according to Roger's theory. The only missing attribute is trialability, which is considered to be indistinguishable among different tools. 
 Therefore, it is believed that the theory was instrumental in forming the research questions, as the subject matter in the question is derived from the theory. In other words, the research question in this paper was structured around the theory.

\subsection{Influence on Methodology due to Theory}
A central component of the methodology is hypothesis testing. It was observed that Roger's theory played a crucial role in the formation of the hypotheses.
For instance, Hypothesis H\textsubscript{1}  posits that explore adopters drive diffusion, which is a category in Roger's theory for classifying adopters.
H\textsubscript{5} examines tool compatibility and H\textsubscript{7} exams the impact of complexity on the diffusion of tools. impact of complexity on tool diffusion. Both the objects of study for these hypotheses belong to the attributes of innovation in Roger's theory. 
In Section 4, the authors also mention that badges were selected as proxies for tool use because they have higher observability, which is another attribute mentioned in the theory.
Thus, it can be concluded that the theory has a strong impact on the methodology, as it informs the development of hypotheses and the choice of the study objects.

\section{Social Influences on Secure Development Tool Adoption}

Social influences on secure development tool adoption: why security tools spread~\cite{xiao2014social}.


\subsection{Theory}

Rogers' diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory.
"the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system"~\cite{rogers1995attributes}.
This paper focuses only on social aspects, especially how DOI focuses on communication.
DOI also includes technological and organizational factors.
There are other theories intentionally not considered: Technology Acceptance Model, Perceived Characteristics of Innovation, Theory of Planned Behaviour, and Model of Personal Computer Utilization.

DOI theory plays a major role in framing the research question.
In the present paper, the authors analyze the role of social influences on the usage of secure development tools and to investigate why these tools are rarely used today.
The authors make use of the DOI theory to approach the research question comprehensive and principled manner.
With a focus on DOI theory, the literature review of the paper discusses existing theories on technology diffusion and prior studies on developers adopting tools and technologies.
Therefore, DOI theory contributes to the understanding of the role social influence plays in the adoption of secure development tools.


\subsection{Influence on Methodology due to Theory}

The methodology of the paper was influenced by the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory.
In the study, qualitative interviews were conducted to understand factors that affect adoption or rejection decisions, and how these factors interact.
To gauge the importance of social and technological factors from the DOI theory, more direct questions were included in the interview to elicit information about participants' security tool adoption choices.
The DOI theory outlines how social and technological factors affect adoption decisions, which the authors illustrate through the findings from the interviews.
