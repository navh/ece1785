\section{Introduction}

In this assignment, we download the \texttt{github.com} 2017 Open Source Survey results.
5,500 respondents from over 3,800 repositories, 500 non-random from other platforms.
Respondents provided insights into their attitudes, experiences, and backgrounds in their roles of using, building, and maintaining open-source software.

\subsection{RQ1: Women Experience Unwelcoming Language}

One of the questions asked respondents if they had experienced language or other content that made them feel unwelcome.

\subsection{Motivation}

The first research question aims to shed light on the relationship between gender and the experiences of individuals on GitHub.
By examining the relationship between gender and the likelihood of observing unwelcoming content on GitHub,
this research can help identify potential areas for improvement in the platform's culture.

\subsection{Hypotheses}

$H_0$ Gender does not play a role in the rate of experiencing unwelcoming language.

$H_1$ Gender plays a role in the rate of experiencing unwelcoming language.

26\% of women and 15\% of men reported experiencing unwelcoming language.

Is this divergence in mean enough to show a relationship between

Due to the vastly different sample sizes, it is unlikely that variance will be identicl.
We perform Welch's unequal variances t-test.

This is still a t-statistic greater than 2.5, well within the rejection region, with a p-value of 0.015, meaning that we can confidently reject the null hypothesis.
Even though we were only able to sample a few women, the incidents of reporting unwelcoming language can not be explained by random variation.

\subsection{RQ2: TODO}

%TODO: Motivation
\subsection{Motivation}

The second research question explores the relationship between using a real name in open-source contributions and the frequency of contributing to software production at work.

\section{Data Cleaning}

Data are provided with a \textsc{README} and a \texttt{notes.txt} file.
\textsc{README} mostly details methodolgy, while \texttt{notes.txt} summarizes known data quality issues.
After filtering data according to these documents, we then TODO.

\subsection{\textsc{README}}

The \textsc{README} mostly contains Readme explains that harassment-related questions have been randomized.

\subsection{\texttt{notes.txt}}

A document outlining six data quality issues ironically enumerated 1,2,2,3,4,5.
Based on the known issues with these data, and the substantial sample remaining, we have applied the following filters guided by the notes document.
The \texttt{NEGATIVE-WITNESS} family of columns were dropped, as they were not related to our research question.
Dates submitted are not considered.
We only consider rows where \texttt{*.ANY.RESPONSE} is 0, \texttt{STATUS} is \texttt{Complete}, \texttt{POPULATION} is \texttt{github}.
We removed 82 \texttt{TRANSLATED} responses.

\subsection{For RQ1}

\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    Column & Yes & No   & Total \\
    \midrule
    Women  & 27  & 77   & 104   \\
    Men    & 435 & 2432 & 2867  \\
    Total  & 462 & 2509 & 2971  \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Unaddressed Issues}

Some data quality issues could not be addressed due to collection methodology.
\texttt{EMPLOYMENT.STATUS} is mutually exclusive, so part-time student and part-time employed is not possible.
\texttt{IMMIGRATION} does not include ``I intend to stay'' options for people living in the country where they were born.
The entire section on helping forces mutually exclusive choices and asks for most recent case where help took place instead of typical.
All questions were optional, so ``prefer not to say'' is presumably encoded by a non-response. Certain questions also have an explicit ``prefer not to say'' response, many of these also have low response rates.
Ages are bucketed unevenly within and different between the two age related questions.
