\title{Evaluation of 2017 Open Source Survey Results \\
{\normalsize ECE1785: Assignment 3 - Intro Quantitative Analysis}}

\author{Amos Hebb, Yilong Wang, Zhenyue Yu\\ \small University of Toronto}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

In this assignment, we analyze the \textt{github.com} 2017 Open Source Survey results,
which gathered insights from over 5,500 respondents across 3,800 repositories and 500 non-random participants.
The survey provides valuable information on attitudes, experiences, and backgrounds related to using, building,
and maintaining open-source software. Based on these results,
we propose research questions to better understand the motivations, impact, challenges, and future trajectory of the open-source community

\section{Gender and Experiencing Unwelcoming Language}

RQ1: Does gender play a role in the rate of experiencing unwelcoming language?

\subsection{Motivation}

As part of the survey, respondents were asked if they had encountered unwelcoming language or content while using \textt{GitHub}.
Based on this question, we have formulated a research question to investigate the possible association between gender and the frequency of such experiences.
Specifically, our research question seeks to understand whether gender has any bearing on the likelihood of encountering unwelcoming language on the platform.
By exploring this relationship, our research can provide valuable insights into potential gender-based disparities in the experiences of individuals on GitHub.
Additionally, this research may help identify areas for improvement in the platform's culture, particularly with respect to fostering a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all users.

\subsection{Hypotheses}

$H_0$: Gender does not play a role in the rate of experiencing unwelcoming language.

$H_1$: Gender plays a role in the rate of experiencing unwelcoming language.
\subsection{}

\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
          & Yes & No   & Total \\
    \midrule
    Women & 27  & 77   & 104   \\
    Men   & 435 & 2432 & 2867  \\
    Total & 462 & 2509 & 2971  \\
    \bottomrule                \\
\end{tabular}

26\% of women and 15\% of men reported experiencing unwelcoming language.

We will use quantitative methods to distinguish if this divergence in means is associated with gender, or simply the result of the expected variance.

Due to the different sample sizes, it is unlikely that variance will be identical.
This is confirmed by measuring the variance, we find women have a variance of 0.19 while men are at a lower 0.12
This can be seen by the more squad density function in the figure below.
Knowing that the groups have different sample sizes and different variances, we will use Welch's unequal variances t-test.
This will allow us to learn if the observed measurement can be explained by normal variations expected in random sampling.

This is still a t-statistic greater than 2.5, well within the rejection region, with a p-value of 0.015, meaning that we can confidently reject the null hypothesis.
Even though we were only able to sample a few women, the incidents of reporting unwelcoming language can not be explained by random variation.

\end{figure}

This figure shows the difference in means, as well as the probability density functions due to the much lower number of respondents identifying as women.

\subsection{RQ2: Professionals use Real Names}

\subsection{Motivation}

The second research question explores the relationship between using a real name in open-source contributions and the frequency of contributing to software production at work.

\subsection{Hypotheses}

$H_0$: Frequency of professionally contributing to open source software has no impact on the use of real name online.

$H_1$: Increased frequency of professionally contributing to open source software is associated with an increased likelihood of using real name online.

\subsection{Data Transformation}

Data are provided in the form of full sentences, but the two variables we are investigating are clearly ordinal rankings.
By mapping both to numeric values, we will be able to apply a rank correlation method to the observations.
This will indicate both the direction and the association between writing open-source code professionally and using a real name online.

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
        \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Language}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Rank}} \\ \hline
        Frequently                              & 3                                  \\ \hline
        Occasionally                            & 2                                  \\ \hline
        Rarely                                  & 1                                  \\ \hline
        Never                                   & 0                                  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
        \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Anonymity}}            & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Rank}} \\ \hline
        Real name                                           & 3                                  \\ \hline
        Consistent pseudonym easily linked real name online & 2                                  \\ \hline
        Consistent pseudonym not linked with my real name   & 1                                  \\ \hline
        Different usernames in different projects           & 0                                  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{l|llll}
               & Pro 3 & 2   & 1  & Rookie 0 \\ \hline
        Real 3 & 888   & 132 & 61 & 35       \\
        2      & 313   & 68  & 33 & 33       \\
        1      & 78    & 17  & 11 & 13       \\
        Anon 0 & 7     & 1   & 4  & 4        \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Printing out counts of respondents between these two rankings reveals the asymmetric responses, with almost all respondents both regularly contributing to open source software professionally and using real names.
This could explain the small Spearman's Rank correlation coefficient of 0.13, as professional status has very little to do with choice of online name.
Initially impressed by a p-value <0.00001, when printed out as absolute numbers it is clear that these ranks are not normally distributed rendering p-value meaningless.

We fail to reject the null hypothesis, these data do not support the idea that professionals are more likely to use their real names when contributing to open source.

\section{Data Cleaning}

Data are provided with a \textsc{README} and a \texttt{notes.txt} file.
\textsc{README} mostly details methodolgy, while \texttt{notes.txt} summarizes known data quality issues.
\subsection{\textsc{README}}

The \textsc{README} mostly contains Readme explains that harassment-related questions have been randomized.

\subsection{\texttt{notes.txt}}

A document outlining six data quality issues ironically enumerated 1,2,2,3,4,5.
Based on the known issues with these data, and the substantial sample remaining, we have applied the following filters guided by the notes document.
The \texttt{NEGATIVE-WITNESS} family of columns were dropped, as they were not related to our research question.
Dates submitted are not considered.
We only consider rows where \texttt{*.ANY.RESPONSE} is 0, \texttt{STATUS} is \texttt{Complete}, \texttt{POPULATION} is \texttt{github}.
We removed 82 \texttt{TRANSLATED} responses.

\subsection{Unaddressed Issues}

Some data quality issues could not be addressed due to the collection methodology.
\texttt{EMPLOYMENT.STATUS} is mutually exclusive, so part-time student and part-time employed are not possible.
\texttt{IMMIGRATION} does not include ``I intend to stay'' options for people living in the country where they were born.
The entire section on helping forces mutually exclusive choices and asks for the most recent case where help took place instead of typical.
All questions were optional, so ``prefer not to say'' is presumably encoded by a non-response. Certain questions also have an explicit ``prefer not to say'' response, many of these also have low response rates.
Ages are bucketed unevenly within and different between the two age-related questions.

\section{Conclusion}

After trying two different statistical techniques to try to prove two hypotheses we thought were quite obvious we only managed to reject one null hypothesis.
It was tempting to play with numbers further, especially with the strange distributions, and we could arrive at very low p-values for unrelated columns.

The data were interesting with a focus on the experiences of developers but would be even more interesting linked with other datasets.
It was difficult to try to do much more than summary statistics as there was no way to even link participants across the two datasets.
The limited sample size on some of the more outstanding demographics made it impossible to conclude anything significant about their behaviour.
