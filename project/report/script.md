# 2:00 - Slide 5 - Mixed Method

We have chosen mixed methods, this is important because we have a fairly confined and testable hypothesis 
A tightly controlled experiment should either accept or reject it, 
but the actual thing we are interested in measuring is the quite nebulous and hard to define, let alone measure, concept of a *good summary*. 

For this reason we have designed two experiments, timed cherry-picking, and summarization, experiments.
the first we give participants a task, time them, and compare accuracy. The second, we ask participants open-ended questions about how they would describe some visuals. 

## 2:45 - Slide 6 - Timed cherry-picking experiment

We had discussed trying to stratify across experience levels, but there are too many combinations of CAD, version control, and 3D art tools for this to be feasable. 
Both experiments use simple random sampling to ensure both the control group and experiment group are identical in aggregate. 

In the cherry picking experiment, 
[produce 5 teapots SL->SR] both groups are given various versions of a file 
[grab SL teapot], the first is an initial file, say a teapot, with no changes, 
[work down teapots] then one where the spout is different, different handle, different knob. 
[grab SR teapot], and a final teapot which has *not all* of those changes. say, just a new spout and new knob.
[focus teapots] Participants will mark the changes to be included or not included to produce the desired teapot.  

Participants in the experimental group will also be given those red-green boolean difference view we saw a couple slides ago.

We will simply count how many mistakes they make as a measure of accuracy, and time the participants.

## 3:30 - Slide 7 - Summarization experiment

In this experiment, we will only present participants with 2 OpenSCAD files, a 'before' and 'after' with various revisions.

Again, the experimental group will be given that red-green boolean difference view. 

We will ask the participants to summarize the changes between these two views, then code the transcripts and look for any patterns that emerge in how participants think about files when they have this new view.
