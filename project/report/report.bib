                  mechanical design. A new CAD program created for the modern

                  the time of development, and usher in a new era of building.
                  The tools used to build with today are supported on the
                  shoulders of giants, but a lot could be done to make them even
                  better. At some point, mechanical CAD lost some of its roots of
                  innovation. Let’s dive into a few of the problems with the CAD
                  programs that exist today and see how to make them better.},
