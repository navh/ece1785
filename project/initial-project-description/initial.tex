\title{Distributed CAD\\
{\normalsize ECE1785: Initial Project Description}}

\author{Amos Hebb, Yilong Wang, Zhenyue Yu\\ \small University of Toronto}

\maketitle

% - Did the team miss any questions or overlook any ambiguities? 

% - Are the RQs reasonable and well-justified?

% - Is there any hidden assumptions?

% - Do you have any suggestions?

% - Do you know any resources that might be helpful to the project?

\section{Introduction}

Challenges of version control for graphical artifacts.
% Lose any mention of interviewing undergrads in the proposal but bring it up with Prof in person.

% It would be nice to get a coffee chat with TODO: Get the name of the solidworks dude.

The goal is to provide recommendations to engineers who are trying to build a visual diff tool for CAD.

RQ: Is this tool needed?
RQ: What kinds of features should a diff tool have?
- Red/Greed additions/deletions?
- Wireframes?
- Time in change.
- Swipe based diff tool.

% Collaboration in CAD is known to be broken.
% Aim to close academic-practitioner knowledge gap.
% 14 challenges identified.
% INTRO
% Focus on Mechanical CAD.
% 3 generations: [standalone, distributed, collaborative]
% - standalone: single user, single machine
% - distributed cad: standalone combined with data managemeent system, shared files.
% - synchronous multi-user cad (MUCAD) (different-place, same time)
% in 2017: \textless10\% of pros use cloud-based CAD, \textgreater50\% of enterprises not considering
% in 2021: 20\% of pros, $>$50\% hobbyists
% interview 20 pros.
% RQ1: What are the collaboration challenges faced by professionals using distributed CAD?
% RQ2: What strategies are CAD professionals or organizations using to remedy collaboration challenges with distributed CAD?
% BACKGROUND
% Distributed vs Collaborative, Distributed needs data management tool
% data management tools can be [manual, partilaly-automated, fully-automated]
% existing probs in literature
% - inconsistency in design practices between designers
% - `some best practices, standardize cite[53,68]'
% - non-interoperability,
% - \textit{dumb solid}, STEP - Standard for the Exchange of Product Data.
% - distributed teams suck more
% - cross-discipline teams suck more
% - IP issues
% - each discipline's respective standards, best practices, jargon, and schemata
% - git also sucks, here are some attempts [27,34,45,88,89,100,110]
% - merge conflicts in git are handled smoothly? (I guess compared to CAD?)
% METHODS
% semi-structured interviews
% 20 Pros, friends, CAD primarily. Experience cad: mean 8, sigma 7.
% 5 aerospace, 4 auto, 4 electronics. (7 unaccounted for?)
% CAD Software: 7 use NX, 7 use SolidWorks, 5 use Creo, 10 use $>$2 regularly (sum!=20 again, not mutually exclusive? Were above? So few participants, why not just be exhaustive?)
% Version Control: 4 use manual version control, 16 use fully-automated PLM tools. 3/4 manual in $<$100 person companies.
% See Figure 1 Appendix A. (horizontal JPEG of a table in CM font... I could almost tolerate the single column, but this is just straight up unreadable. This is also far more useful than the written out version.)
% Learning: 17 responded? 5 update $>$ monthly, 9 $>$annual, 3 $<$annual. (another sum!=20, $>$20 on 'where')
% DATA ANALYSIS
% NVivo, open coding.
% RESULTS
% 4 categories, 14 challenges, sorted by pervasive
% Cat 4.1) Collaborative Design Challenges and Strategies
% C-1) Absent or varied modelling conventions across collaborators
% - manually changing coordinate systems
% - design tolerancing standards different in different teams
% - mechanical/electrical engineering follow different conventions
% - designers fail to follow standards
% S-1) Imposing standards and best practices for modelling
% Author notes nobody other than ID10 has ever seen this work.
% (ID10 is a CEO, I wonder if his engineers say his extra onboarding docs are as helpful as his VPs tell him they are.)
% (amos-thinks: snooze of a suggestion, people said this in code forever, gofmt/black/prettier or die.)
% C-2) Infrequent Model Uploads
% Checks out, doesn't upload, particularly difficult with big assemblies
% No strategy.
% (amos-thinks: notice all the `fully-automated PLM' responders say long lived private checkouts exist... interesting)
% C-3) Lack of designer awareness of model dependencies
% Dep management sucks. Author seems to imply modelling from scratch $>$ dep copy pasta.
% No strategy.
% C-4) Lack of awareness of collaborators' model changes
% Bad pull discipline. Merge conflicts.
% C-5) No Synchronous editing
% 0/20 use `3rd gen' cad tools with this ability.
% S-2) (Yes, Strategy numbers != challenge numbers in this paper) Using assembly configurations, another worker seems to describe branches (personal sandboxes)
% (amos-thinks: sync is really overrated, nobody codes in google docs, I like this suggestion.)
% Cat 4.2) Synchronous communication challenges
% C-6) Cumbersome presentation of CAD models in synchronous work settings
% Design review meetings are awful. Clients make them worse.
% C-7) no back-of-the-envelope CAD
% Cat 4.3) Data Management Challenges and Strategies
% C-8) Lack of interoperability
% Different software, even different versions, incompatible. Mech/EE problems x10.
% S-3) Use dumb solids. Sounds like CAD practitioners have zero interest. It's a hack.
% (amos-thinks: maybe better dumb solids? But frankly I can't see this working, there are no examples anywhere)
% S-4) Simplify CAD models. EE people toss rectangles into mech builds.
% (amos-thinks: obvious hack. just do twice as much work and keep these in sync magically. Not obvious how this strategy helps.)
% C-9) Lack of change summarization support between file versions
% Excel spradsheets, tedious.
% C-10) Lack of version control for non-PLM users
% check-in/check-out function more like locks on files(!?)
% S-5) Just use PLM.
% C-11) Poor CAD file organization
% S-6) Use standard part libraries
% (amos-thinks: This whole para sounds like dependency management strikes again.)
% C-12) Poor traceability of scattered file management
% \textit{redlining}, passing files around with comments. ID20 says aesthetics can't be put it CAD. (dubious, just sounds like trash CAD)
% S-7) Using integrated digital markup tools
% (amos-thinks: Yes, this feels solved, just tools suck.)
% Cat 4.4) Permissioning Challenges
% C-13) Cumbersome stakeholder access to CAD files.
% External collaborators locked out, fragmentation.
% (amos-thinks: Feels solvable with cloud? Maybe? (some sort of browser-viewer?))
% C-14) Lack of stakeholder access to CAD software.
% Basically the same thing, but with added SolidWorks vs NXCAD spice.
