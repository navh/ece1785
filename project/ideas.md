### Extend existing project 

One mentioned was a 2d shooter. 

### Qualitative CAD

Survey for how people are currently doing version control for CAD.

- invading a 1st year CAD class if there is a group project component.
- interviewing FASE or Solar Car team.
- creating physical objects with differences and interviewing laypeople.

### Quantitative CAD

OpenSCAD? 
- Create VS Code plugin
- Extend existing VS Code plugin 
- Create a 'diff' view which shows red/green areas between revisions.
- Link these differences back to areas in the code (colour the code based on the difference it causes?)

OpenScad is open source, c++, big codebase, unclear actual use.

There is an openscad vscode extension https://github.com/Antyos/vscode-openscad
- not dead, not super active either.
- look at how models are rendered in this. 
### Create some sort of new version control and evaluate how people find it to use
