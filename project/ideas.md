### Extend existing project 

One mentioned was a 2d shooter. 

### Qualitative CAD

Survey for how people are currently doing version control for CAD.

- invading a 1st year CAD class if there is a group project component.
- interviewing FASE or Solar Car team.
- creating physical objects with differences and interviewing laypeople.

### Quantitative CAD

OpenSCAD? 
- Create VS Code plugin
- Extend existing VS Code plugin 
- Create a 'diff' view which shows red/green areas between revisions.
- Link these differences back to areas in the code (colour the code based on the difference it causes?)

OpenScad is open source, c++, big codebase, unclear actual use.

There is an openscad vscode extension https://github.com/Antyos/vscode-openscad
- not dead, not super active either.
- look at how models are rendered in this. 
### Create some sort of new version control and evaluate how people find it to use

git for a non-linear audio editor

git for reinforcement learning agents

### CAD 

- Chris was not able to find anything existing for CAD version control, maybe one paper.
- Amos brought up interviewing FSAE or Solar car.

How to measure the maintainability of the software system?

What are the effects of code review on software quality, productivity, and developer satisfaction?
